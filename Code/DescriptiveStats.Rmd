## Descriptive Stats for Manuscript

### Bronchiectasis

```{r}
# lobes with bronchiectasis present (i.e. score != 0)
bronch_present <- bronch %>% filter(score != 0)
cat("Number of lobes with bronchiectasis present:",nrow(bronch_present),"\n")

# lobes with moderate-to-high-degree bronchiectasis present (i.e. score = 2 or 3)
bronch_high <- bronch %>% filter(score == 2 | score == 3)

# print percent moderate-to-high-degree for RML, LLS, RUL
pct_high_bronch <- function(lobe_code){
  denom <- bronch %>% filter(lobe == lobe_code) %>% nrow()
  numer <- bronch_high %>% filter(lobe == lobe_code) %>% nrow()
  round(100 * numer / denom,1)
}

cat("Percent of RML with moderate-to-high-degree bronchiectasis present:",pct_high_bronch("RML"),"\n")
cat("Percent of LLS with moderate-to-high-degree bronchiectasis present:",pct_high_bronch("LLS"),"\n")

```

### Thin wall cavities

```{r}
# lobes with ln present (i.e. score != 0)
thin_present <- thin %>% filter(score != 0)
